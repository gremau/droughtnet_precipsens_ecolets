# Statistics

Descriptions of statistical models, model selection, and outputs.

For now there is just one model output into the `sensitivity_analysis` directory. It is the output of a mixed effects linear model with NEON domain as a random effect. This is what the ecosystem sensitivities in the manuscript are currently based on. For the most part, the models used are well described in the jupyter notebooks in [`../jupyter/`](../jupyter/).
