# Droughtnet Metadata

For now processed data files (in `DATADIR/USHCN_derived`, `DATADIR/MODIS`, and `DATADIR/sensitivity_analysis`) have YAML formatted metadata files with the same name (and .yaml extension) located in the same directories. So, _filename.csv_ has a metadata file called _filename.yaml_. Not all of these are complete yet, but additions to metadata are a work in progress.
